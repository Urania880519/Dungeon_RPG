I'm Princess Loretta from the North Kingdom. I've been kidnapped 3 years ago by an unknown monster....
That was a rainy day and I dressed up like a servant, sneaked out of the palace.
I was too curious about what the world outside might look like.  
All of a sudden, I lost consciousness during my little adventure, after a drastic pain from the back of my head.
I found myself chained up in this tower when I woke up. Please help me out...I miss my home.
Can you help me find the master of this tower? Who brought me here?

==========CHOICES ARE YOURS=============

A. Give the poor princess your promise and go find the monster.
B. It's too dangerous. Walk away.
