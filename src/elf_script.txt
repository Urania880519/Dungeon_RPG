I'm the house elf Dobby in this tower. Oh but don't look at me like that;
Dobby is a good elf. The master of the tower tricked me many many years ago and made me the house elf.

Yeah I know she's the evil. But what can I do? At least I am the one who carry food for the princess trapped in the attic verey day. You must have met her, right?
Come on, Dobby know what you want. You want to get out of this place.

However, let me warn you. You will, yes you will meet the master, whether you want to save the princess or not. In fact, the master knew that you're here the second you accidentally enter the tower. She has a crystal ball and she can see you from it. She even know that we're talking right now.

What? Of course she doesn't care. She's very, very confident.
And like Dobby has just mentioned, Dobby is just a house elf. 
Dobby do nothing other than house chores. Therefore, I can offer you some food to help you restore your energy. What do you want?
